        <h3>Read Before Playing:</h3> 
        <p>This website hosts a Game Dashboard; clicking on a box will bring you to a tool called Google Colab. Colab is an online code-hosting platform by google used to give users access. I've set the permissions to public view only. However, you can still see, edit, and interact with the code, but changes won't be saved so that nothing can get broken. When you first open the notebook, you will see the game title, game overview, and the game's connection to the class. Once you are done reading a little about the game, you will see the section "Pre Game Functions - Run all Cells Prior to Playing." This is a section that contains all the functions that make the game run, and you can view them by expanding the section. All you need to do is run them. To do this, hover over the cell, and a play button with appear, followed by a warning. The warning is because this isn't a notebook by google, but it is still safe. Click play, then run anyway; see the guide below: </p>

            Now you are ready to read the game instructions. Then, once you're ready, click play on
            the game cell. The output will appear below the cell. See here:

            <h2>Central Dogma Decoder</h2>
            <p>In this game, you can enter a strand of DNA code, and then it will 
                decode it for you. First, it translates and displays the DNA to mRNA 
                code, then the tRNA code, and lastly, the letter code. Watch over your 
                shoulder, though, because the world's security depends on only you 
                having this machine.</p>

            <h2>Planet Discovery: Emission Match</h2>
            <p>In this game, you are racing against other astronomers to identify the 
                elements in a planet's atmosphere. You must match the order of the 
                displayed emission spectra of elements in the planet's atmosphere 
                by entering the element symbol. You don't get to look at the spectra 
                for long, but if you are successful, you can name the planet. Enjoy!</p>

            <h2>Photosynthesis Tycoon</h2>
            <p>In this game, you are a plant trying to collect as much energy as possible. 
                To do this, you must photosynthesize. Collect water, carbon dioxide, and 
                sunlight using your energy. Use your resources and leaves to create more 
                energy. Grow and expand your plant, but stay energized, or you lose. </p>
