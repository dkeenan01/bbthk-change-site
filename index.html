    <h1>Science Changes</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        Science is a process that seeks the truth but is always changing. 
        This frustrates some people especially after dedicating time memorizing 
        science fact. Science changing, however, is human knowledge progressing, 
        so it should hardly be shamed. Instead, science changing should be celebrated. 
        The dashboard below displays some of the changes from the fields of science we 
        explored in class.
