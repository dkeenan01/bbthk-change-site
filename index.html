            <h2>Central Dogma Decoder</h2>
            <p>In this game, you can enter a strand of DNA code, and then it will 
                decode it for you. First, it translates and displays the DNA to mRNA 
                code, then the tRNA code, and lastly, the letter code. Watch over your 
                shoulder, though, because the world's security depends on only you 
                having this machine.</p>

            <h2>Planet Discovery: Emission Match</h2>
            <p>In this game, you are racing against other astronomers to identify the 
                elements in a planet's atmosphere. You must match the order of the 
                displayed emission spectra of elements in the planet's atmosphere 
                by entering the element symbol. You don't get to look at the spectra 
                for long, but if you are successful, you can name the planet. Enjoy!</p>

            <h2>Photosynthesis Tycoon</h2>
            <p>In this game, you are a plant trying to collect as much energy as possible. 
                To do this, you must photosynthesize. Collect water, carbon dioxide, and 
                sunlight using your energy. Use your resources and leaves to create more 
                energy. Grow and expand your plant, but stay energized, or you lose. </p>
